####Instructions:

This folder contains a basic set up for a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/) project (set up with Vue-Cli 3) called "My Kitten App".
The task would be to create a page that that looks similar to the one in the [mock up included](Mock_Up.png)
and has the following functionality:

- on top a "kitten of the day" in a card like element, with like / dislike icon (does not need to be functional)
- below kittens to choose from with a heart icon (does not need to be functional, however only kittens with property "isFavourite" true
  should have a filled heart).
  
  (all necessary images, icons and data can be found in [../src/assets]())
- upon clicking on one of the choosable kittens it will be placed on top as "kitten of the day" and the previous kitten of the day should go
  back into the list of choosable kittens.
- if you see any other issues with the code feel free to improve it.


Please return your solution to us until the end of 28.07.2019.
